If I have time, I would like to model what happens to the network when user demand is drastically increased.  This
would illustrate what happens when new data is available, and many people are attempting to access the servers
all at once.  I am specifically interested in how this impacts runtime of my algorithms, as well as the impact on
total (flow*cost).
