README:

To run this program, you will need to have the current version of python 2.7 installed.  After unzipping the folder, run `nf_main.py` from the console to start the program.  It will produce both source and output files in the format specified in the default project, placing them inside the '/io/' directory.  Graph topology is randomly generated at runtime, using a timestamp based ID for matching files together.  Once a solution has been found, I invite you to use the files generated as input for your own algorithms to compare with my outputs.
